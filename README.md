# Mobile_Churn_Prediction_jsteen1
Development of logistic regression model to predict mobile subscriber churn

This repository contains all relevant files for the mobile subscriber churn prediction project.

The files include: 
  Churn_Train(1).csv file containing training and testing data 
  churn_script.rmd R markdown file containing R script 
  Customers_To_Predict.Rdata R workspace file containing unseen data to be classified
  churn_workspace.Rdata R workspace file containing probability of churn for unseen data, in addition to all other objects created in script
  churn_report.pdf report containing findings from analysis and recommendations to management based on data and analysis
  churn_presentation.pptx slideshow for presentation to management
  
Please note that the comments regarding specific numbers contained within churn_script.rmd will not exactly match output when the script is executed. These figures were included for fixed proportions of randomly selected training and testing data. While the proportions will not change, the indiviual records comprising the training and testing set will differ each time the first code chunk is run. It is expected that subsequent executions of the code should yield very similar numeric results.
